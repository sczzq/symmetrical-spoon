#include <iostream>

A C++ program is a sequence of text files that containe declarations.
They undergo translation to become an executable programe, which is executed when the OS calls its main function.

Certain words in a C++ program have special meaning, and these are known as keywords. Others can be used as identifiers. Comments are ignored during translation. Certaine characters in the program have to be represented with escape sequences.
The entities of a C++ program are values, objects, references, functions, enumerators, types, class members, templates, template specializations, namespaces, and parameter packs.
Preprocessor macros are not C++ entities.
Entities are introduced by declarations, which associate them with names and define their properties. The declarations that define all properties required to use an entity are definitions. A program must containe only one defintion of any non-inline function or variable that is odr-used.

given radius and center point (x, y).
output a uniform distributed random point in the circle.

center point and output are all float number.


Note:
a point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be int the circle.
output point is 2-d point.

-----------------------
given rand7(), an uniform distributed random function.
to implement rand10(), another uniform distributed random function.

output an uniform distributed random number using rand10() for each call.

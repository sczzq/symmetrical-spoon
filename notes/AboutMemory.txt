After some time of study of language, the programmable design language,
and then study some system call or system concept, the knowledge about
data structure and algorithm is out of my mind, that is to say, there 
less thing about data structure and algorithm in my mind.
How to concer this?
How to do to have all of this knowledge?
What to do of myself to have a good knowledge about these all things?
Back to my mind? How to back to my mind?
Do more execise? I think I understand it at the time to study it, reading,
practicing, doing home work, doing company's job, and so on.
But, donot have enough memory in my mind about these all things.
Sometimes I can remember this thing, and other times I can only can talk
about that thing, and could not say one word about this thing.
My memory? Is bad? And this is my talent?
Or, this is myself? This is myself need to have a knowledge?
Just to say, I am a ordinary people?
Or, to say, I have poor memory?
But, what I should to do is to enlarger my memory, not to justify it.
More words, I should know what I should to understand it, and to memory it.
Most words, I should know my finite memory in my body, and try to have a good
use of it.
What should I do? How to do?
This is a class, and a lesson, from every day's life.
